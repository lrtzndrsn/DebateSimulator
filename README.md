# READ ME 
This is a debate simulator, which I wrote while learning about OO. It simulates a classroom, where people debate and can win and lose, etc.

# How to run
Head to the debate folder and run "dotnet run" from there. 

This will simulate a debate as simulated in Program.cs

Play around with the code and make your own classroom in Program.cs!
